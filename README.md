# Node, Express and Sequelize Rest API Boilter plate with Sqlite Database

This is a straight forward boiler plate to build Rest API with express and sequelize to connect and fetch data from sqlite database.

#### Third party node package managers used

* bcrypt to support password hashing for user authentication
* Body parsing via body-parser
* cypto-js and jsonwebtoken to support token based authentication
* sqlite3 and sequelize to support database integration

## Getting started

```javascript
//git clone
git clone https://github.com/arorarahul/node-restful-api.git

//move to the required directory
cd node-restful-api

//install all the dependencies 
npm install
